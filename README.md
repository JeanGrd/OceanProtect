# OceanProtect

OceanProtect is an application that aims to provide information on the pollution level of a given coastal city with additional information (the average temperature of the city for example). We can search for one of these cities with a quick access to Google Maps to locate the place we are interested in with more precision (whether to go on a trip or simply to find out about the pollution level of a given place). If we are interested in a place, we can save it in our favorites in order to access it more quickly in the future.

Have a good trip with OceanProtect.
